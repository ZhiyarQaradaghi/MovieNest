## Welcome to MovieNest: Your Ultimate Movie Library

As the creator of MovieNest, I’ve built this application to make your movie experience better and easier. MovieNest is a full-featured app that helps you find, organize, and enjoy movies. Whether you’re on your computer or mobile device, MovieNest is designed to work smoothly and look great.

# What MovieNest Does:

Find and Manage Movies: With MovieNest, you can search for movies, read details about them, and add your own favorites to your collection. You can also update or remove movies whenever you want.

Works Everywhere: I’ve made sure that MovieNest works well on both web and mobile platforms. The app uses modern technologies like Node.js and SQL for the backend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface. The mobile app is built with Flutter, so it’s fast and responsive on your phone.

# Why I Created MovieNest:

I love movies and technology, so I wanted to create an app that combines both. MovieNest is the result of my passion and hard work, designed to give you a better way to explore and enjoy movies.
